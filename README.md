2. Include the galleries3.php file on your page.
	<?php include 'path_to/galleries3.php'; ?>
3. Edit galleries3.php to add your AWS Access Key, AWS Secret Key, and Bucket Name.
4. Include Bootstrap CSS and JS on your page. Available from [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)
5. Call the funciton on your page
	<?php galleries3($path, $captions, $echo); ?>
	$path (string) -- the folder within the bucket. (Example: "photos/")
	$captions (boolean) -- Create captions from the file names. (Example: "evening_sunset.jpg")
